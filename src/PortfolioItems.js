üìùAbout
As university students, we all understand that one of the biggest struggles of living by yourself is cooking food. We wanted to make it easy to find and craft new recipes, while still eating healthy.

üõ†Ô∏è Built With
We used React, JavaScript, ChakraUI, and Bootstrap for the frontend. For the backend. we used CockroachDB and Express.

‚öôÔ∏è Usage
We didn't have time to host the backend, so the database won't work for regular users. If you host it locally, you are able to create recipes, search for recipes, and view recipes.

‚õ∞Ô∏è Challenges
Before hacking started, one of our teammates felt sick and had to go home. Without him, a lot of our planning and ideas had to be delayed and reinvisioned. He was a big part of keeping our team together and energized throughout the night, so we were all discouraged from him leaving.
Instead of giving up, we took the loss of a teammate with even more determination to win. We utilized our resources, such as discord for communication, to help us continue moving forward with our project. As a result, we still managed to go beyond our expectations and make considerable progress on our project.

üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap
In the future, we hope to add:
Accounts/login system
Forums for people to talk about recipes and health
A tracker that keeps track of your meals, calorie intake, etc`

  A currency bot where the player grows crops, takes care of animals, and trades with merchants to gain coins.
      
  Farmout is a Currency/Fun bot where you own and take care of a farm.
      
  There are tons of different animals that you can take care of, all giving you unique items like wool and milk. You have to plant and water seeds for crops, which you can sell and trade with the marketplace for other cool items. We‚Äôve only recently added 2 new revolutionary updates: contracts and locations. These make the game feel more realistic, and make it feel like you are actually running a farm.
